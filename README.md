# 4-BIT-Digital-to-Analog-Converter
A 4-Bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) is an electronic circuit that converts a 4-bit digital signal into an analog voltage or current. The output analog signal is proportional to the input digital code. DACs are widely used in applications such as audio processing, signal generation, and control systems.
